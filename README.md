# ML_Project_on_KNN

We will build a classifier that takes an image of a handwritten digit and outputs a label 0-9. We will look at a 
particularly simple strategy for this problem known as the nearest neighbor classifier. 
To run this notebook we should have the following Python packages installed: 
 numpy 
 matplotlib 
 sklearn` 
1. The MNIST dataset 
"MNIST" is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 gray-scale images handwritten digits. 
The original training set contains 60,000 examples and the test set contains 10,000 examples. In this 
notebook we will be working with a subset of this data: a training set of 7500 examples and a test set of 
1,000 examples.
